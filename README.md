# 🎯 Number Guessing Game
Put your psychic powers to the test!  
The computer secretly picks a number between 1 and 100 — your mission?  
Guess it within 10 tries. You'll get clues after each guess:

- **"Your guess is highly lower"** if you're way off (more than 10 away)
- **"Your guess is a bit lower"** if you're close-ish (within 10)
- Same logic for higher guesses!

Nail the number? You’ll be showered in dramatic congratulations.  
Fail? The game mockingly reveals the number and your defeat.

Simple. Addictive. Weirdly intense.
Choose wisely. 😄
